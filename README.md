# College Reviews

The College Reviews application will be the best resource when deciding what college fits best for you! This single-page application allows you to click on a college name to view all the reviews for the specific college. If you decide you want to read the reviews for a different college, you can do so by clicking another college name at the top of the page.

## Motivation

The thought process behind this project was for users to easily research how others may have felt about the preferred college the user is interested in. By creating this application, a user will have a better take on what to expect when attending a specific college.

A user may also choose to add a new review by entering the fields in the form. The user can choose which college they are writing the review about by using the dropdown selection. They have an option to edit or delete their review once submitted.
